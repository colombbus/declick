If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t * following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.1.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t * @see R.curryN\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\n\t *\n\t *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\n\t *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t *      var g = f(3);\n\t *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry1(function curry(fn) {\n\t  return curryN(fn.length, fn);\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 63 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _curry1 = __webpack_require__(2);\n\tvar curry = __webpack_require__(62);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Returns a new function much like the supplied one, except that the first two\n\t * arguments' order is reversed.\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.1.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig (a -> b -> c -> ... -> z) -> (b -> a -> c -> ... -> z)\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to invoke with its first two parameters reversed.\n\t * @return {*} The result of invoking `fn` with its first two parameters' order reversed.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var mergeThree = (a, b, c) => [].concat(a, b, c);\n\t *\n\t *      mergeThree(1, 2, 3); //=> [1, 2, 3]\n\t *\n\t *      R.flip(mergeThree)(1, 2, 3); //=> [2, 1, 3]\n\t * @symb R.flip(f)(a, b, c) = f(b, a, c)\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry1(function flip(fn) {\n\t  return curry(function(a, b) {\n\t    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);\n\t    args[0] = b;\n\t    args[1] = a;\n\t    return fn.apply(this, args);\n\t  });\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 64 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _arity = __webpack_require__(19);\n\tvar _isPlaceholder = __webpack_require__(66);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Internal curryN function.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity of the curried function.\n\t * @param {Array} received An array of arguments received thus far.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} The curried function.\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = function _curryN(length, received, fn) {\n\t  return function() {\n\t    var combined = [];\n\t    var argsIdx = 0;\n\t    var left = length;\n\t    var combinedIdx = 0;\n\t    while (combinedIdx < received.length || argsIdx < arguments.length) {\n\t      var result;\n\t      if (combinedIdx < received.length &&\n\t          (!_isPlaceholder(received[combinedIdx]) ||\n\t           argsIdx >= arguments.length)) {\n\t        result = received[combinedIdx];\n\t      } else {\n\t        result = arguments[argsIdx];\n\t        argsIdx += 1;\n\t      }\n\t      combined[combinedIdx] = result;\n\t      if (!_isPlaceholder(result)) {\n\t        left -= 1;\n\t      }\n\t      combinedIdx += 1;\n\t    }\n\t    return left <= 0 ? fn.apply(this, combined)\n\t                     : _arity(left, _curryN(length, combined, fn));\n\t  };\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 65 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = function _isFunction(x) {\n\t  return Object.prototype.toString.call(x) === '[object Function]';\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 66 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = function _isPlaceholder(a) {\n\t  return a != null &&\n\t         typeof a === 'object' &&\n\t         a['@@functional/placeholder'] === true;\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 67 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = function _isString(x) {\n\t  return Object.prototype.toString.call(x) === '[object String]';\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 68 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = function _map(fn, functor) {\n\t  var idx = 0;\n\t  var len = functor.length;\n\t  var result = Array(len);\n\t  while (idx < len) {\n\t    result[idx] = fn(functor[idx]);\n\t    idx += 1;\n\t  }\n\t  return result;\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 69 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _curry2 = __webpack_require__(1);\n\tvar map = __webpack_require__(13);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Returns a lens for the given getter and setter functions.
